- Use Lovable Cloud tables for signed-in sheets, campaigns, and NPCs with owner-scoped RLS; signed-out visitors use transient demo state so the experience is inspectable without an account.
- Keep RPG interaction logic in client-safe modules and never assume the public reference site's private authenticated data is available.
- Weapon and Nomenclature damage come only from the capped tables in src/lib/game.ts (WEAPONS, NOMENCLATURE_RANGES); combat and sheets must reuse them so no damage exceeds the rulebook.
- The campaign master may edit any member sheet (RLS `is_master_of_sheet`); members read all table sheets/campaign/visible NPCs, and non-master UI is wrapped in a disabled fieldset. Why: players see everything, only the master edits.
- Invites use `campaigns.invite_token` + `join_campaign_invite` RPC via `/mesa?convite=`. Why: one-click Google entry without a password.
- Sheet notes (Anotações) are stored inside the existing `story` column after a marker (splitStory/joinStory in src/lib/game.ts), so no database change is needed and the original backend keeps working.
